TODO
----

- spell cast actually takes a turn
- bug in which mobs die when using fireball after 1 turn (related?)
- implement bonfires - brazier!
- deck max draw (for now)
- stairs (for next level)

future
------

- start game screen
- "you died" screen
- deck builder - can pick up cards and equip them into deck
- cards drop from mobs? bosses? treasure chests? bonfires?
- better map builder
